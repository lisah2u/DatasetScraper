While customers and analysts exhibit a range of opinions—from cautious optimism to outright skepticism—it's clear that AT&T's initiative could set a new standard in service reliability and customer care. With the telecommunications landscape ever-evolving, AT&T's rivals are likely to scrutinize the program's success closely before crafting their responses. For AT&T, the guarantee offers tangible benefits in customer loyalty, brand perception, and market differentiation.\n",

If AT&amp;T fails to deliver on its guarantee, consumers will receive a $5 reward card and business customers will receive a choice of benefits or bill credit.\\n### Dive Insight:\\nAT&amp;T is working to build trust with consumers as part of a multiyear strategy to grow the telecommunications company’s customer base.\\nAT&amp;T Guarantee is the latest initiative and could help the company maintain consumer loyalty following a major service interruption last year.\\nAT&amp;T’s February 2024 wireless network outage lasted at least 12 hours and prevented customers in all 50 states from using voice and data services, according to a[Federal Communication Commission report](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404154A1.pdf)released in July 2024. The incident blocked more than 92 million phone calls, including more than 25,000 attempts to reach 911.\\nAT&amp;T responded by offering[$5 credits to affected customers](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/att-credited-customers-affected-by-its-widespread-outage-5-was-it-enough/711766/), which was met with mixed reactions. The AT&amp;T Guarantee seeks to standardize how the company deals with future outages.\\nAs part of AT&amp;T Guarantee, fiber customers who experience network interruptions for at least 20 minutes and wireless customers who experience at least 60 minutes will now receive a bill credit for a full day of service. Small businesses will receive a selection of options following an outage. The recompense is only valid for an incident impacting 10 or more towers.\\n\"Customers tell us they want confidence in their service provider and offering a guarantee makes them four times more likely to choose a brand that offers one,” Kellyn Kenny, chief growth and marketing officer at AT&amp;T, said in a prepared statement Wednesday. “It’s about being transparent, taking action and ensuring our customers know they are supported.”\\nThe company has invested more than $140 billion in its network and customersupport operations since 2019, according to Jenifer Robertson,EVPand general manager for AT&amp;T Mass Markets &amp; Mobility.\\n“That’s brought us to where we are today —becoming the first and only carrier that offers a guarantee for wireless and fiber networks,” Robertson said in a prepared statement.\\nThe customer care investment amounts to more than $750 million, the company told CX Dive in an email. Improvements include technology that lets the company proactively communicate with customers during an outage and the ability for customers to continue online support chats on the go without the session timing out.\\n* [![Post to LinkedIn](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/linkedin.svg?092716141024)](<http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/att-guarantee-customer-service-outage-compensation/736958/&amp;title=AT&T aims to draw customers with service guarantee>)\\n* [![Share on Facebook](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/facebook.svg?440116200824)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/att-guarantee-customer-service-outage-compensation/736958/)\\n* [![Post to X](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/x.svg?092716141024)](<https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=AT&T aims to draw customers with service guarantee https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/att-guarantee-customer-service-outage-compensation/736958/ via @cxdive>)\\n* [![Print this page](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/print.svg?440116200824)](javascript:window.print())\\n* [![Email this page](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/email.svg?092716141024)](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#447b1731262e21273079051061767210617674252d2937617674302b61767420362533617674273137302b29213637617674332d302c617674372136322d272161767423312536252a302121622529347f062b203d792c303034376177056b6b3333336a273137302b292136213c3421362d212a2721202d32216a272b296b2a2133376b2530306923312536252a30212169273137302b29213669372136322d2721692b313025232169272b2934212a3725302d2b2a6b7377727d717c6b)\\n* [![License this article](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/static/img/social_icons/article_page/cart.svg?092716141024)purchase licensing rights](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/selfservice/article-licensing/submit/?newspostUrl=https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/att-guarantee-customer-service-outage-compensation/736958/)\\nFiled Under:[Customer Service](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/topic/customer-service/)\\n### CX Dive news delivered to your inbox\\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\\nEmail:\\n* Select user consent:By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our[Terms of Use](https://www.techtarget.com/terms-of-use/)and[Privacy Policy](https://www.techtarget.com/privacy-policy/).

            "--FINAL RESULT: Below is an in‐depth editorial that gathers and synthesizes both customer and analyst perspectives on AT&T’s new customer guarantee program. This initiative – which promises credits for extended service outages and long hold times – has sparked a lively debate among users and industry watchers alike. Read on for an overview of the program, a summary of customer reactions (both positive and mixed), analyst viewpoints (both bullish and cautious), and a discussion of its broader strategic benefit and competitive implications.\n",

            "\n",
            "In response to widespread service disruptions (including a nationwide wireless outage lasting 12 hours last February), AT&T has rolled out what it calls the “AT&T Guarantee.” The program promises that eligible wireless customers who experience an outage of 60 minutes or more—and fiber customers who face interruptions of at least 20 minutes—will receive bill credits that can offset the cost of a full day’s service. In addition, customers contacting customer service are now promised a connection to technical support within five minutes (or the option to schedule a callback). These features are intended not only to provide immediate relief but also to signal that AT&T stands firmly behind its service quality.\n",

            "\n",
            "Many consumers say that a promise to “make it right” builds confidence. In surveys highlighted in AT&T’s own messaging, customers claim they are up to four times more likely to choose a brand that backs its service with a guarantee. For users frustrated by previous outages and long support wait times, such a concrete promise offers reassurance that should issues arise, compensation is on the way.\n",

            "### Reservations and Mixed Reactions\n",
            "\n",
            "On the other hand, some customers recall that when AT&T previously offered a $5 credit following the 12‑hour outage, reactions were mixed. Critics on social media and in follow‑up reports argued that such a small amount hardly compensates for the inconvenience caused by a prolonged loss of service. In other words, while the guarantee is a positive step in theory, many users wonder whether the compensation will be generous enough to truly redress the disruption.\n",

            "\n",
            "Several analysts see the guarantee as a bold, much‑needed differentiator in a crowded, competitive telecom market. They point out that by taking accountability for network disruptions, AT&T reinforces its $140+ billion investment in infrastructure upgrades and customer service enhancements. In their view, this is more than a mere publicity stunt—it’s a strategic move aimed at rebuilding consumer trust in the wake of previous service failures.\n",
            "\n",
            "*Key points from bullish analysts include:*\n",
            "• A visible commitment to reliability that may increase subscriber loyalty.  \n",
            "• Enhanced marketing and competitive differentiation in both the wireless and fiber markets.  \n",

            "• The risk that a guarantee program may mask underlying reliability issues without driving real improvement.  \n",
            "• The potential financial exposure if outages become more frequent and credits add up over time.  \n",
            "• Skepticism that a nominal credit (like the previously offered $5) might be seen as token compensation that does little to restore lost trust.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some believe that while AT&T’s approach may generate short‑term goodwill, it could also set a precedent that forces costly commitments on competitors—if and when they decide to follow suit. However, several experts question whether rivals can match this guarantee without incurring significant financial risk or whether they will adopt different customer experience innovations instead.\n",

            "• **Rebuilding Trust:** After a high‑profile outage that disrupted connectivity for millions, the guarantee is meant to reassure customers that AT&T will “make it right.”  \n",
            "• **Differentiation:** AT&T is currently the only major carrier offering a comprehensive guarantee for both its wireless and fiber services. This can serve as a strong marketing differentiator.  \n",

            "• If the guarantee drives measurable improvements in customer loyalty and market share for AT&T, rival carriers may feel compelled to introduce similar programs.  \n",
            "• However, competitors may hesitate if they view such guarantees as too risky—especially if their networks have not faced comparable reliability challenges or if the associated payouts could weigh on their margins.\n",
            "• Some may choose instead to invest more in proactive network improvements or different customer service innovations rather than commit to guarantee-style compensation.\n",
            "\n",

On the one hand, it offers real promise by addressing past outages head‑on and promising to compensate customers when things go wrong. On the other, both customers and some analysts remain cautiously skeptical about whether the compensation levels really match the inconvenience caused and whether the guarantee is a sustainable long‑term strategy.\n",

Basey,150 Tex. 666,245 S.W.2d 484, 486(1952)](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/stewart-v-basey-no-888914620), set out the rule applicable ina caselike the instant one:\\n\\'The right of competentpartiesto make their own bargains is not unlimited.The universal rule for measuring damages for the breach of a contract is just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained.By the operation of that rulea partygenerally should be awarded neither less nor more than his actual damages.A partyhas no right to havea courtenforce a stipulation which violates the principle underlying that rule.Inthose casesin whichcourtsenforce stipulations ofthe partiesas a measure of damages for the breach of covenants, the principle of just compensation is not abandoned and another principle substituted therefor.Whatcourtsreally do inthose casesis to permitthe partiesto estimate in advance the amount of damages, providedtheyadhere to the principle of just compensation.Restatement of Contracts,Sec. 339, accurately expresses the rule as follows:\\n\\'(1)An agreement, made in advance of breach fixing the damages therefor, is not enforceable as a contract and does not affect the

Spalding,Bracewell &amp; Patterson, Houston, forappellee.\\nBeforeDOYLE,DUGGANandLEVY, JJ.\\nOPINION\\nDOYLE, Justice.\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment awardingappelleedamages for breach of contract in the amount of $71,820 actual damages, plus $11,440.60 prejudgment interest.\\nOnOctober 6, 1978,appellant,Community Development Service, Inc., d/b/a,Champion Equity Corporation(Champion Equity)entered into a contract withappellee,Replacement Parts Manufacturing, Inc.(RPM)to purchase 144 residential lots over a three-year period.Title to the lots was to be acquired as each one was\"taken down\"or closed.Appellantwas also required to pay interest toappelleeand property taxes on any of the 144 lots for which legal title had not been acquired.\\nBetweenOctober 1978andOctober 1980,appellant\"took down\"only 30 lots.Additionally,appellantstopped making tax and interest payments toappellee.Consequently, inOctober, 1980appelleenotifiedappellantthat the contract was cancelled.In response thereto,appellantfiled suit alleging thatappelleehad breached his contract by failing to deliver lots with construction of the roads in accordance with theCity of Staffordand Federal Housing Authority(FHA)specifications.Appelleefiled a counter-claim, alleging thatappellant\\'s failure to pay property taxes and interest constituted a material breach of the contract.\\nThe jury found thatappellantmaterially breached the contract and found thatappelleesuffered damages in the amount of $71,820 based on the lost profits on the non-sale of 114 residential lots.\\nIn its first two points of error,appellantcontends thatthe trial courterred in entering judgment based on the jury\\'s response to special issue numbers 11 and 12 becauseappellantdid not have a contractual obligation to pay property taxes astheyaccrued or to pay interest toappelleeinOctober 1980.Thus, as a matter of law, such failure did not constitute a material breach of the contract in question.\\nIn response to special issues 11 and 12, the jury specifically found thatappellant\\'s failure to pay interest and property taxes astheyaccrued toappelleeinOctober 1980constituted a material breach of the contract.\\nAppellantrelies on his contractualinterpretation ofparagraphs II(b)and(c)of the contract of sale to substantiate his contention.These paragraphs describe the manner in which the purchase price of the lots shall be paid:\\n(c)The balance of the total purchase price shall be payable to Seller as follows:\\n(1)The sum of $310,500.00(representing remaining 90% of lot price multiplied by 30 lots)shall be paid to Seller 60 days after notification to Buyer by Seller, which shall include certification of lot completion, at which time Seller shall convey to Buyer by general warranty deed, insured by owners title policy, good and indefeasible title to Buyer to 30 lots selected by Buyer, and\\n\\\\* \\\\* \\\\*\\n\\\\* \\\\* \\\\*\\n(4)The sum of $351,900.00(representing remaining 90% of lot purchase price multiplied by 34 lots)shall be paid to Seller within 1095 days of said notification to Buyer by Seller of lot completion at which time Seller shall convey title as above described to remaining 34 lots.\\nProvided however,(a)Buyer may at any time tender to Seller $10,350.00 per lot and demand that Seller convey title to lots selected by Buyer and the purchase price of any lots so acquired shall be counted in reduction of the next due installment of Buyer to Seller as above described;(b)Buyer shall pay all taxes as due from the date of lot completion and furnish Seller with copy of said paid tax receipts and(c)Buyer shall pay Seller interest at the rate of 10% per annum on the unpaid balance outstanding, such interest to commence upon the date of lot completion and to be payable quarterly thereafter.\\nSpecifically,the appellantcontends for the first time on appeal, that the last paragraph cited above, which describesthe appellant\\'s duty to pay taxes and interest toappellee, is part ofparagraph II(c).\\nThe contract also provides as follows:\\nProvided that the obligations of Seller as enumerated inparagraphs(a)-(f)of Paragraph Ionpages 1-2of this Contract\\nshall be conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer as set forth inParagraphs II(b)and(c)of this Contract with respect to each group of lots to be purchased thereunder.\\nAppellanturgesthis courtto find that the above contractual language requires the seller(appellee)to fulfill certain\"conditions precedent\"before the buyer(appellant)will be responsible for payment of taxes and interest as allegedly required inparagraph II(c).Some of the conditions which the seller is required to fulfill are described inparagraph I(a):\\nSeller agrees to the following:\\n(a)Seller shall clear the street right-of-way and utility easements within Kingsway, it being understood that(1)any additional clearing shall be done by Buyer at its expense, and(2)Seller shall minimize damage to the trees within Kingsway;(b)each lot or reserve being conveyed shall be free of trash, garbage, or any improvements not contemplated hereby, and except for clearing of trees, be in a condition suitable for commencement of construction of single family detached housing; ...\\nAppellantclaims that becauseappelleefailed to keep each lot free of trash,the appelleehad not fulfilled the conditions which activateappellant\\'s responsibility for taxes and interest.The appelleeargues that the language does not constitute a condition precedent, but merely a covenant, the breach of which might be a defense to any contract action byappelleeagainstappellant.\\nAs a general rule, where neitherpartyhas alleged that the contract is vague or ambiguous, the construction of the contract is a question of law forthe court.[City of Pinehurst v. Spooner Addition Water Co.,432 S.W.2d 515(Tex.1968)](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/city-of-pinehurst-v-894340871).The courtalso construes the meaning of contracts where neitherpartymakes allegations specifying the language subject to different interpretation, so that the opposingpartyis prepared to offer evidence explaining the meaning.[Sale v. Contran Corporation,486 S.W.2d 161(Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas1972, writ ref\\'d n.r.e.)](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/sale-v-contran-corp-888014355).The courtis required to give effect to the intention ofthe partiesas expressed or as it is apparent in the writing.[Pitts v.

Co. v. George E. Gibbons &amp; Co.,537 S.W.2d 1, 3(Tex.1976)](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/hohenberg-bros-co-v-893762286).\\nInthe case at bar, to hold thatthe appellee\\'s three-year obligation to make tax and interest payments on the lot was suspended untilappellantcleared the occasional debris that accumulated on the lots would impose\"an absurd result\"particularly in light of the other conditions which suspend tax and interest payments.\\nParagraph II(b)provides for payment only upon the completion of the development of 144 lots.Paragraph II(c)provides that the balance of the total purchase price is only payable sixty days after seller notifies\\nthe buyer by sending certification of lot completion and conveying to buyer a general warranty deed.\\nThe paragraph clearly demonstratesthe parties\\' intention to conditionappellant\\'s obligation to pay the balance on the lots on their certification as being complete.Since such intent is not clearly demonstrated in the paragraph requiring the payment of taxes and interest,wefind thatthe appellee\\'s obligation to pay taxes and interest was not part ofparagraph II(b)or(c)and was therefore not conditioned onappellee\\'s keeping the lots clear of trash and debris.Points of error one and two are overruled.\\nIn points of error three, four, and five,appellantcontends thatthe trial courterred in granting judgment in favor ofappelleefor damages because there was no evidence, or alternatively insufficient evidence of the\"benefit of the bargain\"or the value of the property at the timeappelleeknew or should have known of the breach as compared to the value the property should have had at that time.\\nGenerally, the measure of damages for breach of contract is the amount necessary to placeplaintiffin a financial position equal to that which it would have had if the contract had been performed by bothparties.[Little Darling Corp. v. Ald, Inc.,566 S.W.2d 347](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/little-darling-corp-v-886559494)(Tex.Civ.App.--Dallas1978, no writ).Under this standard, the injuredpartyis compensated only for the damages or

M. DeGuerin, Austin, forpetitioners.\\nSmith &amp; Furr, Austin, forrespondents.\\nHICKMAN, Chief Justice.\\nThe controlling question inthis caseis whether the language quoted below stipulating the damages recoverable for the breach of a lease contract is a provision for liquidated damages or for a penalty.The trial courtconstrued it as a provision for a penalty and, finding that the lessor suffered no damages by lessee\\'s breach except $38.50 caused by the destruction of a partition door in one of the leased buildings, rendered judgment for that amount only.The Court of Civil Appealsupheldthe trial courtin its refusal to award liquidated damages, but reversed that portion of the judgment awarding only $38.50 as damages and remandedthe casetothe trial courtfor the sole purpose of determining the amount of actual damages sustained by the lessor.Tex.Civ.App., 241S.W.2d 353.\\nBy a contract in writingpetitioners,E. C. Stewartand wife, leased torespondent,James Marvin Basey, three store buildings on SouthCongressAvenue in thecity of Austin.The lease stated that it was for a term of five years, beginning onJanuary 1, 1949, and ending at midnight onDecember 31, 1954.The dates cover a period of six years, but for the purposes of this opinion it is immaterial whether the term was five years or six years.The lease provided for a monthly rental of $325.00, payable each month in advance.Respondentwent into possession under the lease and paid the monthly rentals throughNovember, 1949, during which monthhevacated the buildings.On the followingDecember 5th the keys were returned topetitionersupon their request, since which timetheyhave executed leases to other tenants.The provision of the contract whichweare called upon to construe reads as follows:\\'The failure to pay any monthly installment of rental when such installment is due shall terminate this lease at the option of Lessors.The failure of Lessee to make said payment or payments or the breach of this contract otherwise by him shall render him liable to Lessors, as agreed liquidated damages, the sum of One Hundred Fifty(150)Dollars per month for each and every month of the unexpired term of this lease which shall become due and payable when the option to terminate this lease is exercised or at the time of the breach of this contract otherwise by Lessee if any, and the payment thereof be secured by lien on the property of Lessee in said Store Buildings at said time.\\'\\nAnother provision of the contract is:\\'That the violation of any term of this lease by eitherpartyhereto shall terminate the same at the option of the other.\\'\\nIt will be observed that liability for the payment of $150.00 per month as liquidated damages is not limited to the breach of any one particular covenant of the contract.The covenant to pay the rent when due is but one of the covenants the breach of which would give rise to a claim by the lessors for $150.00 per month for each and every month of the unexpired term of the lease.\\nVolumes have been written on the question of when a stipulated damage provision of a contract should be enforced as liquidated damages and when enforcement\\nshould be denied because it is a penalty provision.One line ofcases, of which[Eakin v. Scott,70 Tex. 442,7 S.W. 777](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/eakin-v-scott-894524051), is typical, states that the intention ofthe partiesgoverns and another line states that their intention is immaterial, but when the results are examined there appears but little disparity between them.All agree that to be enforceable as liquidated damages the damages must be uncertain and the stipulation must be reasonable.There is a statement inthe opinion in[Eakin v. Scott,supra](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/eakin-v-scott-894524051), which, standing alone, would lead to the conclusion that the damages inthat casewere certain in amount.But when the entire opinion is read, it becomes obvious that the damages were very uncertain in the contemplation ofthe partieswhen the contract was executed; and that is the true test of uncertainty.The true theory is well expressed inWilliston on Contracts, Revised Edition, Sec. 779, p. 2192, in this language:\\'But as has been seen, the chief, almost the only, means of determining whetherthe partiesin good faith endeavored to assess the damages is afforded by the amount of damages stipulated for, and the nature of the breach upon which the stipulation was agreed to become operative.This is but saying in other words that the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the stipulation is decisive.\\'\\nThe caseswhich hold that the intention ofthe partiescontrols impute tothe partiesan intention to provide for a penalty when it would be unreasonable and unjust to do otherwise, even though their language clearly expresses the contrary intention.Theyindulge in a presumption in order to arrive at the justice ofthe case.The caseswhich disregard the intention ofthe partiestreat the question as one of the legality of the stipulation.The reasoning in[Langever v. R. G. Smith &amp; Co., Tex.Com.App.,278 S.W. 178, 179](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/langever-v-r-g-892873407), is typical of that employed incaseswhich announce that the intention ofthe partiescontrols.The statement in the opinion that\\'the real intention ofthe partieswhen ascertained will control\\'is followed by the statement that such intention\\'is not necessarily ascretained by the words employed\\'.Regardless of which line ofcasesis followed,the courtswill not be bound...\\nTo continue reading\\nRequest your trial\\nSubscribers can access the reported version of this case.\\n### You

thatshehad asked a representative ofappelleeto pick up the machine\"because it has not performed as the salesman promised\"; and suggested that the machinery be picked up immediately.OnJuly 23, 1971,appellantwroteappelleeacknowledging receipt of her letter, citing her to a disclaimer of warranty clause in the lease, and suggesting thatshecontact the supplier of the equipment concerning any repairs;

Weiss,Joe Meador, San Antonio, forappellants.\\nJames E. Aderhold,Seagal V. Wheatley,Oppenheimer, Rosenberg, Kelleher &amp; Wheatley,Mary Elizabeth Carmody, San Antonio, forappellee.\\nMcKAY, Justice.\\nOnSeptember 29, 1972, Dr. Newsom Stool entered into a standard AIA Construction Contract with Jess andJack Mayfieldd/b/aMayfield Construction Company(hereinafterMayfield)for the construction of a residence in San Antonio, Texas.The final contract price for the project was $120,335.00 with a time for completion of 200 days.Fidelity &amp; Deposit Companyof Maryland(hereafterF &amp; D)issued payment and performance bonds on the project.\\nDr. Stool financed the residence through theSan Antonio Savings Association(hereinafter SASA)which agreed to lend Dr. Stool $90,000 toward cost of building a home at an interest rate of 71/2%.SASA agreed that it would hold the 71/2% interest commitment open untilAugust, 1973.Because of the interest commitment deadline and interim financing costs, Dr. Stool and Mayfield added a provision to the construction contract that if Mayfield completed the residence in less than 200 days, Dr. Stool would pay Mayfield a bonus of $50.00 per day for every day prior to the 200 day period in which the residence was to be completed, but if Mayfield completed the residence in more than 200 days, $50.00 per day would be deducted from the contract price for a period not to exceed 60 days.InAugust, 1973, when the loan commitment was about to expire, the residence was approximately 75% complete but SASA extended the loan commitment toSeptember 1, 1973.However, onSeptember 1, 1973, the residence was still incomplete, and the interest rate was raised to 8%.OnNovember 29, 1973, the loan was closed.\\nDuringSeptember, 1973, it became apparent that Dr. Stool was dissatisfied with the quality of the work, and during that month, an extensive punch list was compiled of various items of work that had yet to be completed or were unsatisfactorily completed.From aboutDecember 26, 1973, Dr. Stool occupied the residence, and duringJanuary, 1974, the majority of the items of work on the list were completed; however, Dr. Stool was still dissatisfied with the condition of the residence and refused to tender the balance due under the contract.OnSeptember 30, 1974, Mayfield instituted an action to recover the balance due under the contract in the amount of approximately $4,000.00.Dr. Stool filed a counterclaim against Mayfield and F &amp; D alleging that the contract had not been substantially performed, that the construction of the residence was not done in a good and workmanlike manner, that the delay in completion of the residence caused him to pay a greater rate of interest, and thatheshould recover damages in the sum of $60,000.00 which was the reasonable and necessary cost of repairing the defective work.\\nDuring the period of late1974through March of1978, bothpartiesengaged in negotiations concerning the reasonable and necessary repairs to Dr. Stool\\'s home.InMarch, 1978, Mayfield finally refused to perform any work on the residence, and onMay 22, 1978, Dr. Stool entered into a contract withS &amp; H Remodeling Companyof San Antonio.In that contract S &amp; H Remodeling agreed to remedy the defects in the residence for the sum of $57,660.04.At the time of trial, all of the work had not yet been completed.\\nOnJanuary 9, 1979, trial was had before a jury, and judgment was rendered against Mayfield for the reasonable and necessary cost to correct the defects in the residence and for damages resulting from Mayfield\\'s failure to complete the residence by the contract date.Additionally, judgment was rendered in favor of F &amp; D against Mayfield for indemnity of any and all amounts which F &amp; D would be required to pay to Stool as a result of the judgment.Both Mayfield and F &amp; D filedmotions for judgment non obstante veredictoand for anew trial, all of which were denied.Appellantshave duly perfected this appeal.\\nThe determinative issue in this appeal concerns the proper measure of damages for the breach of a construction contract.In twenty-one points of errorappellantscomplain of the measure of damages submitted to the jury bythe trial court.\\nIn response to special issues the jury found that:\\n1.The contract ofSeptember 29, 1972, to construct the Newsom Stool home was not substantially performed byMayfield Construction Company.1\\n2.TheMayfield Construction Companyfailed to construct Newsom Stool\\'s family home in a good and workmanlike manner pursuant to the contract ofSeptember 29, 1972.\\n3.Mayfield Construction Companyfailed to correct the defects caused by its failure to construct the family home for Newsom Stool in a good and workmanlike manner.\\n4.The reasonable and necessary cost to correct the defects in the construction of Newsom Stool\\'s family home inMarch, 1978, was $35,381.80.\\n5.Newsom Stool suffered damages in the amount of $3,794.96 for increased interest expense as a result of theMayfield Construction Company\\'s failure to complete the family home byJune 28, 1973.\\n6, 7 &amp; 8.AppellantFidelity &amp; Deposit Companyof Maryland should not be awarded its attorney\\'s fees for litigation inthe trial courtor appeal tothe courtof civil appeals or appeal tothe Supreme Court of Texas.\\nAppellantscontend that under the record the correct measure of damages was the difference in value of the building as constructed and its value had it been constructed according to the contract.\\nRestatement of Contracts,§ 346(1932), states that where the contractor breaches the contract because of defective or unfinished construction, the owner may recover:\\n\"(i)the reasonable cost of construction and completion in accordance with the contract, if this is possible and does not involve unreasonable economic waste; or\\n(ii)the difference between the value that the product contracted for would have had and the value of the performance that has been received bythe plaintiff, if construction and completion in accordance with the contract would involve unreasonable economic waste.\"§ 346at 573.\\nTexas courtshave long held that where defects in construction of a building may be remedied, the measure of damages for the owner is the cost of such remedy or repair, but where such defects cannot be remedied without injury to the structural efficiency of the building as a whole, the measure of damages is the difference between the value of the building as constructed and its value had it been constructed according to the contract.[Atkinson v.

Hendricks,386 S.W.2d 221, 223](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/cooper-concrete-co-v-894060644)(Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas1965, no writ).\\nBothappellantsandappelleerely uponthe caseof[Hutson v. Chambless,157 Tex. 193,300 S.W.2d 943, 945(1957)](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/hutson-v-chambless-no-885769868).The court in[Hutson](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/hutson-v-chambless-no-885769868)stated:\\n\"Where it is necessary, in order to make the building comply with the contract, that the structure, in whole or in material part, must be changed, or there will be damage to parts of the building, or the expense of such repair will be great, then it cannot be said that there has been a substantial performance of the contract.Generally, where there has not been such substantial performance, the measure of the owner\\'s damage is the difference between the value of the building as constructed and its value had it been constructed in accordance with the contract.Such a recovery would be just to bothparties.It is manifest that to measure the owner\\'s damage by the cost necessary to make the building conform to the contract would often be an injustice, because in many instances such cost would amount to almost as much as the original contract price.\"\\nIn a concurring opinion in Hutson, Judge Norvell wroteat page 946:\\n\"I concur in the decision reached in this particular case as it seems that assuming the contract has not been substantially performed, the recovery permitted under the facts pleaded by Chambless would be measured by the difference between the value of the building as actually constructed and its value had it been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications of the contract.This rule, however, if it can be properly called a general rule, is subject to numerous exceptions.This difference in values is not necessarily the measure of damages when the default of the contractor is wilful or intentional.\\\\* \\\\* \\\\* Nor should it be the exclusive measure where it is shown that the owner of property desiring construction thereon is dependent upon a loan commitment which is based upon completion of the work in accordance with plans and specifications, nor where an essential element of the contract from the owner\\'s standpoint is the\\'gratification of his taste\\'for whichhehas contracted and agreed to pay money \\\\* \\\\* \\\\*.\"(Emphasis added)\\nThus the rule in Texas seems to be that where the correction of defects and deviations would impair the structure as a whole, or require a great expense, the correct measure of damages is the difference in the value of the structure as constructed and its value had it been constructed...\\nTo

Transdyn Controls, Inc., Appellee FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF TRAVIS COUNTY, 201ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT NO. D-1-GN-02-002371, HONORABLE LORA J. LIVINGSTON, JUDGE PRESIDING MEMORANDUM OPINION This case involves a contract between an equipment supplier and an electrical subcontractor on a City of Austin construction project. Transdyn Controls, the equipment supplier, sued subcontractor Austin Traffic Signal Construction Co., L.P. ( ATS ) for failing to pay for the equipment Transdyn had supplied for the construction project. Transdyn also sued Cajun Constructors, Inc., Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, and Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance Underwriters, Inc., alleging that they were responsible for Transdyn s damages because they had provided payment bonds on the project. ATS filed a counterclaim against Transdyn, asserting that Transdyn had breached the parties equipment-supply contract by providing defective equipment and by failing to complete other obligations under the parties contract. After a bench trial, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of Transdyn. In six issues, ATS asserts that the trial court erred by (1) admitting certain witness testimony into evidence, (2) failing to award ATS an offset for training fees it had incurred as a result of Transdyn s breach, and (3) awarding incidental delay damages to Transdyn. We affirm the trial court s judgment. BACKGROUND In September 2000, the City of Austin entered into a construction contract with Cajun Contractors, as general contractor, to build the Walnut Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Austin ( Walnut Creek project ).1 Cajun, in turn, entered into a $3.7 million subcontract with ATS to provide the electrical and instrumentation work on the Walnut Creek project. ATS s scope of work under its subcontract included providing all labor, materials, and equipment to design, furnish, install, calibrate, test, adjust, and place in operation the facility monitoring and control system also known as the process instrumentation and control system ( PICS ). PICS includes the sensors and instruments used to monitor and control the facility and permit remote access and control of those sensors and instruments. Although ATS was responsible for PICS under its subcontract with Cajun, the specifications for the Walnut Creek project required that the City of Austin approve the PICS supplier and installer. ATS asked Transdyn, one of four city-qualified PICS suppliers, to submit a proposal to supply the PICS for the Walnut Creek project. ATS told Transdyn, and the project specifications provided, that the Walnut Creek project was scheduled to be completed 360 days after construction began. Transdyn s representative also testifiedthat ATS s representative told Transdyn 1 The facts recited in this opinion are taken from the testimony and exhibits admitted at trial. 2 that ATS s PICS budget was $1,000,000. ATS also sent Transdyn the project specifications covering PICS. Based on all the information it had received from ATS, Transdyn submitted a $1,000,000 proposal for furnishing, but not installing, portions of the [PICS] for the subject project as defined in [the sections of the project plans and specifications ATS] provided. The proposal also specified that Transdyn would provide certain training. The PICS section of the project plans, which were incorporated by reference into the proposal, included the following payment terms for the PICS part of the project: Partial Payment Limits: A. Partial payments for Work required under PICS Subsystems is shown as a percent of Lump Sum Item amount: 1. Submittals, not including PICS O&amp;M manuals, 15 percent maximum, 2. Performance Acceptance Tests PAT, 20 percent, minimum. 3. Reliability Acceptance Tests RAT, 20 percent, minimum. 4. PICS O&amp;M manuals, 5 percent, minimum. (Emphasis in original). Transdyn s proposal stated that payment would be according to mutually agreeable payment terms resulting in neutral cash flow for the project. 2 ATS accepted Transdyn s proposal and authorized Transdyn to begin work on the project on September 14, 2000. 2 Transdyn s representative testified at trial that neutral cash flow is a common term used in the construction industry to indicate pay as you go . . . so as you incur the costs, you receive payment for them. 3 Approximately two months after construction began on the Walnut Creek project, Transdyn, ATS, and Cajun agreed on the following payment schedule for Transdyn s work: As agreed upon at our partnering meeting, the following table is Transdyn s revised Milestone/Payment Schedule. Note that the payment dates are the estimated dates for payment of the invoice and are approximately one month after theissuing of the invoice. Milestone Payments Cont. Amt: $1,000,000 % Retained 5% Payment Less Retainage Expected Pay Date 5% $50,000.00 $47,500.00 Oct-00 Hardware Submittal Approval 10% $100,000.00 $95,000.00 May-01 Hardware Shipped to Staging 40% $400,000.00 $380,000.00 Jan-01 Performance Acceptance Tests Complete 20% $200,000.00 $190,000.00 Aug-01 Reliability Acceptance Tests Complete 20% $200,000.00 $190,000.00 Sep-01 5% $50,000.00 $47,500.00 Sep.-01 $50,000.00 $50,000.00 Sep.-01 Milestone % Acceptance of Schedule/Schedule of Values/Hardware List O&amp;M Manual Approved Final Payment 100% $1,000,000.00 (hereinafter, milestone payment schedule ). Transdyn s representative testified that the purpose of this agreement was to achieve the mutually agreeable payment terms resulting in neutral cash flow 4 described in Transdyn s original proposal by requiring ATS to pay Transdyn approximately one month after receiving Transdyn s invoice for each milestone. ATS s representative testified that this agreement meant that Transdyn would be paid a certain amount after each milestone was reached and final payment after the last milestone was reached, rather than by a date certain or invoice date. In addition to modifying the contract s payment terms, ATS and Transdyn also later agreed to modify the training provisions of their contract. This modification resulted from requests by the project engineers that Transdyn make certain design changes to the PICS. Transdyn notified ATS that making the requested changes would require a change-order and an increase of $11,375.61 to the parties contract. After negotiations, the parties agreed to incorporate the changes into the existing contract at no extra charge to ATS and, in exchange, release Transdyn from some of its obligation to provide post-installation training. Transdyn made the requested changes to the PICS system, but when PICS was installed and ATS requested a week of training from Transdyn, the parties realized there was a misunderstanding about the modification. Transdyn contends that it had agreed to perform the change-order work valued at $11,375 in exchange for a release from its entire three-week training commitment valued by Transdyn at $12,000. ATS contends that it only agreed to release Transdyn from two of the three weeks of training and that Transdyn was still required to provide one week of training. Because the parties could not resolve this matter during construction and because ATS was under construction deadlines, ATS provided all three weeks of the training. There were other problems between Transdyn and ATS on the Walnut Creek project, the most significant of which was a delay in completion of the project. The project was originally 5 scheduled to finish by September 2001, but it was not ready until June 2002. This was due, in part, to the fact that Austin experienced unusually heavy rainfall in the autumn of 2000 and, in part, to problems caused by the project engineer, the general contractor, other subcontractors, and either Transdyn or ATS, depending on the party testifying. The end result for Transdyn was that it had to wait on the delays to complete its portion of the contract and it did not receive its final, and largest, payment in September 2001 when the project was expected to be complete. Transdyn also complained that ATS did not pay Transdyn s initial invoices in a timely manner. ATS, however, argued it was not responsible for the delay and, in fact, that Transdyn itself was responsible for delays. Specifically, ATS contends that the engineers and other contractors had to delay testing the PICS because Transdyn had ordered its engineer, without whom testing could not occur, to leave Austin right before PICS testing. ATS also contends that Transdyn was responsible for the numerous PICS problems and defects discovered during testing and that these defects had to be repaired before the project could continue. Transdyn contends that, despite all the delays on the project, it had shipped the PICS equipment according to the terms of the parties agreement and had PICS ready to be installed, started, and tested in September 2001, which was the original completion date for the construction project and the final payment date on the parties payment schedule. Because of the delays and problems with payment throughout the project, Transdyn sent ATS demands for payments and asked for assurances about the delays. On January 7, 2002, while the project was still ongoing and the PICS was still not complete, but after Transdyn states it had completed 95% of its work, Transdyn submitted its final invoice for the project and demanded 6 the remainder due under the entire contract $477,500. When ATS did not pay, Transdyn filed this suit, alleging breach of contract by ATS and seeking damages and attorney s fees. ATS counterclaimed for breach of contract as well, alleging that Transdyn had failed to complete its work and had failed to provide the agreed-upon one week of training per the parties oral modification. After a bench trial, the trial court found that ATS had materially breached the contract by not paying Transdyn according to the terms of the contract and awarded Transdyn its damages, including incidental damages, and attorney s fees. The trial court also found that Transdyn had breached the contract by failing to perform terminations and repairs on the PICS, and awarded ATS its damages and attorney s fees for that breach. After the offsets for Transdyn s breach were credited, the trial court awarded Transdyn $82,403 in damages, plus pre-judgment interest of $28,451.36, $50,000 in attorney s fees, and $9,619 in court costs. ATS appeals. DISCUSSION In six issues on appeal, ATS contends that the trial court erred by (1) admitting certain testimony by Transdyn s corporate representative, Brian Luiz, (2) failing to credit ATS with an offset for training costs incurred because of Transdyn s breach of contract, and (3) awarding Transdyn incidental delay damages. Testimony of Brian Luiz In its first issue, ATS contends that the trial court erred in admitting, over objection, Brian Luiz s testimony about the change-order request and agreed modification to the training requirement in the parties contract. ATS objected to Luiz s testimony on the grounds that it was 7 inadmissible hearsay and that Luiz had no personal knowledge of the change-order or the parties modification negotiations. ATS objected to the following testimony by Brian Luiz: Q: [Transdyn s Counsel] Are you familiar with this Change Order dispute I described to the Judge in my opening statement? A: I am. Q: Will you please convey, in your own words to Judge Livingston, what Transdyn[] s position is with regards to the Change Order components of this litigation? ATS s counsel: Excuse me, Your Honor, I m going to object to any testimony from this witness until it s proven that he has first-hand knowledge of this, because I think the discovery shows he was not involved in the first hand on a first-hand basis with respect to the negotiation of this alleged Change Order. The Court: Establish what personal knowledge, if any, he has or what other knowledge he might have. Transdyn s counsel: Sure, Your Honor. And he s our corporate representative. We re just asking him to say what this what we ve pled, what this company s position is with regards to it. Not anything that he hasn t doesn t have direct knowledge of. The Court: Okay. ATS s Counsel: Okay. Q: [By Transdyn s Counsel] Okay. Mr. [Luiz], were you involved with your employees and personnel in discussing the Change Order disputes while the project was on-going? A: I was. Q: Okay. Did you ever have any discussions with anyone at ATS about the Change Order dispute? A: I believe I did. 8 Q: Okay. Who? A: Mr. House. Q: Okay. And who at Transdyn[] did you discuss the Change Order dispute with? A: With Mr. Smith and Mr. Maxwell. Q: Okay. And both of whom work underneath you, correct? A: That s correct. Q: Okay. And you testified earlier at some point, you started getting copied on a lot of the correspondence that we ve seen and will be seeing; is that correct? A: That s correct. Q: Did any of that correspondence involve this Change Order dispute? A: The letter I previously reviewed that illustrated the cost of those Change Orders of that Change Order was presented to me in a normal course of our reading file. Q: Okay. And you you reviewed it then and familiarized yourself with Transdyn[] s position concerning the Change Order dispute? A: I did. Q: Okay. What is Plaintiff s Exhibit No. 15? A: That is the bid summary as prepared on June 22nd 2000 for this project. Q: Okay. And it itemized and details out what Transdyn[] was going to perform and how and what internally it cost or how it tracked the cost of this job, correct? A: That s correct. Transdyn s Counsel: Your Honor, we move to admit Exhibit15. ATS s Counsel: No objection, Your Honor. 9 The Court: It s admitted. Q: [By Transdyn s Counsel] Can you please convey to the Judge what Transdyn[] s position is with regards to the Change Order Dispute? A: It was my understanding that when we prepared the Change Order, the cost for that Change Order was $11,000 and some added amount of money $11,000 plus. ATS s Counsel: Excuse me, Your Honor. Objection to this witness testifying to any what anybody else told him about the presentation of the Change Order. The Court: He hasn t done that yet. So far he just said it s his understanding that the cost was going to be $11,000. ATS s Counsel: And I m entitled to know he s testified to what his understanding was. And he said his understanding came from Maxwell or Smith. The background of this, Your Honor, is Mr. Smith and Mr. Harutanian had a conversation heard overheard by Mr. House. Those are the three parties that have first-hand knowledge of what this alleged agreement is. Anything this witness is going to testify about is going to be hearsay that he got from talking to Smith or somebody else. He has no first-hand knowledge of this alleged agreement on this Change Order. The Court: Well, so far he hasn t related what anybody told him. All he s saying is he thinks it was $11,000. So far that s okay. He thinks it was $11,000. You can cross-examine him on that point. But, please, don t tell us what anybody else told you, except obviously Mr. House, you can certainly tell us what he said. The Witness: Okay. The Court: Go ahead Mr. Spencer. Q: [By Transdyn s Counsel] Okay. Again, what is Transdyn[] s position with regard in this litigation with regards to this Change Order? 10 A: That the $11,000 that was shown on the earlier document of the cost, was the cost to perform the Change Order. No Change Order was issued on the project at its conclusion. It was my understanding that that was in exchange for the PLC, Programmable Logic Controller training on the project, which we had estimated at $12,000. ATS s Counsel: Well, may I take him on voir dire? The Court: No. ATS s Counsel: Okay. I m not entitled to know from whom he gained that understanding? The Court: When you cross-examine him you can ask him whatever you want. So far there s no point in you taking him on voir dire. It s not different from your cross-examination. Just be patient, you re going to get to have him and ask him whatever you want when it s your turn to cross-examine him. You can voir dire him for the admissibility of the document or something like that. So far he hasn t said anything that would justify you interrupting the direct examination about something ATS s Counsel: All right. Q: [By Transdyn s Counsel] Mr. [Luiz] The Court: I m sorry. I missed the last part. In exchange for what? The Witness: In exchange for the cost that we had for the PLC training that is shown on Exhibit 15, down towards the middle ofthe page there s a 12,000-dollar cost item there. The Court: Okay. Q: [By Transdyn s Counsel] Okay. And how much is do you recall even approximately how much ATS is attempting to assert as an offset to our claim for this this training for a part of the training obligation? A: I thought it was 17,000, but I could be incorrect. But it was more than the 12,000. 11 Q: It was more. Okay, does it appear that the amount of the Change Order is almost the exact it s 11,000 and some change. Does it appear to be almost the exact same amount as we had budgeted for this actual training, for all of the training here, according to Exhibit 15? A: It does. Q: Okay. Would did you ever authorize anybody from Transdyn[] to to just partially trade out that that obligation? A: I did not. Q: Would you have? A: Not at those costs, no. Q: Okay. Because it doesn t make sense that you would have traded out $8,000 for $11,000. Is that what you re getting at? ATS s Counsel:Well, Your Honor, that s leading. The Court: Sustained. Transdyn s Counsel: Okay. The Witness: No what The Court: Hang on, hang on. He s going to ask you another question. The Witness: Okay. I m sorry. Q: [By Transdyn s Counsel] We estimated the PLC training here, according to our bid, which predates this whole dispute, we estimated it at $12,000 for all three weeks; is that correct? A: That s correct. Q: Okay. And so if you divide that $12,000 by three, what does that come out to a week? A: $4,000 a week. 12 Q: Okay. And what s your understanding with regards to the dispute as far as the two versus three weeks? What is what is their position? A: I understand their position to be that in exchange for the 11,000-dollar Change Order, we were only going to provide one week of training and they were going to delete two weeks of the training. Q: Okay. And what is Transdyn[] s position with regards to that? A: Our position is . . . that we traded all of the training for that. We review a trial court s decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion. In re J.P.B, 180 S.W.3d 570, 575 (Tex. 2005). A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts without regard to any guiding rules or principles. Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985). The rules of evidence define hearsay as a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Tex. R. Evid. 801(d). As the trial court observed, the objected-to portion of Luiz s testimony contains no out-of-court statements Luiz did not testify about what other people told him about the modification negotiations. Accordingly, his testimony was not hearsay and the trial court properly overruled ATS s objection. ATS also argues that the objected-to portion of Luiz s testimony was not based on his personal knowledge as required by Rule 602 of the Texas Rules of Evidence. Under Rule 602, a witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Tex. R. Evid. 602. Personal knowledge is [k]nowledge gained through firsthand observation or experience, as distinguished from a belief 13 based on what someone else has said. Black s Law Dictionary 951 (9th ed. 2009). Thus, a witness can only testify about those matters, facts, or events that he perceived firsthand. See Strickland Transp. Co. v. Ingram, 403 S.W.2d 192, 195 (Tex. Civ. App. Texarkana 1966, writ dism d) ( Perception of fact by the senses of the witness, that is, firsthand knowledge, is a fundamental qualification of testimonial competency. ). Luiz testified only about matters that he perceived firsthand as Transdyn s vice president: ¢Transdyn s litigation position regarding the modification; ¢His understanding of ATS s position on damages regarding the modification; ¢The identity of people with whom he discussed the change order or related modification; ¢The identification, existence, and contents of corporate documents; ¢That Transdyn had valued the cost of three weeks of training at $12,000 in its pre-contract bid summary; ¢That $12,000 divided by three weeks equals $4,000 per week; ¢That the change order request was for approximately $11,000 worth of work and that amount was almost equal to the amount Transdyn budgeted for training in its bid summary; and ¢That he had not, and would not have, authorized anyone from Transdyn to trade $12,000 worth of work for only two weeks of training. Luiz did not testify about the negotiations leading up to the modification or what was said or agreed to in those negotiations. Based on our review of this testimony, we conclude that Luiz testified about 14 matters about which he had personal knowledge. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling ATS s objection.3 ATS sfirst issue is overruled. Training Modification ATS s second issue on appeal also involves the parties modification to the contract s training provisions. At trial, ATS argued that the parties agreed to eliminate only two of the three weeks of training in exchange for the change-order work. Transdyn argued at trial that ATS agreed to eliminate all three weeks of training. The trial court made no finding regarding the agreed training modification, nor does the judgment award ATS damages for the training costs. Thus, we may infer that the trial court found that the parties agreed to eliminate all three weeks of training. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 299 (omitted elements will be supplied by presumption in support of judgment if supported by evidence). ATS contends the trial court s finding is in error because there was legally or factually insufficient evidence that the parties agreed to eliminate all three weeks of Transdyn s PLC training obligation in exchange for the change-order work. We review theevidence supporting the trial court s findings of fact for legal and factual sufficiency by the same standards applied to a jury verdict. See Ortiz v. Jones, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996). For a legal sufficiency challenge, we review the evidence in the 3 Even if the trial court had erred in allowing Luiz s testimony, either because he lacked personal knowledge or because his testimony included inadmissible hearsay, ATS fails to explain how that error probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment. To reverse a judgment based on an error in the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must show that the error probably resulted in the rendition of an improper judgment by demonstrating that the judgment turns on the particular evidence admitted or excluded. Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a); Interstate Northborough P ship v. State, 66 S.W.3d 213, 220 (Tex. 2001). 15 light most favorable to the judgment, crediting favorable evidence if a reasonable factfinder could, and disregardingcontrary evidence unless a reasonable factfinder could not. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807 (Tex. 2005). We will sustain a legal sufficiency complaint if the record reveals (1) a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact, (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact, (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla, or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of a vital fact. Id. at 810. More than a scintilla of evidence exists if the evidence rises to a level that would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions. Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 601 (Tex. 2004). In a factual sufficiency challenge, we consider and weigh all of the evidence in the record, both supporting and against the finding, to decide whether the finding should be set aside. See Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001). We will set aside the judgment only if the finding is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986). In a bench trial, the trial court is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. McGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 696 (Tex. 1986). The trial court may believe one witness, disbelieve others, and resolve inconsistencies in any witness s testimony. Id. at 697. Our review of the record indicates the following evidence supporting the trial court s implied finding that the parties agreed to eliminate all three weeks of training from the contract: 16 ¢Transdyn s pre-contract bid summary valuing three weeks of training at $12,000; ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn valued three weeks of training at $12,000; ¢Transdyn s letter to ATS stating that requested changes to the scope of work on the project would cost ATS $11,375.61; ¢Luiz s testimony thatno change-order was issued on the project; ¢Transdyn s letter to ATS stating Transdyn s position that it had agreed to the perform the change-order work in exchange for three weeks of PLC training, not two; and ¢Luiz s testimony that the change-order work was done as a no cost change because Transdyn was trading its costs incurred on the work for the cost it saved by not having to do the PLC training. The only evidence contrary to the trial court s implied finding was an ATS employee s testimony that Transdyn s project manager told him that Transdyn had agreed with the project engineer to trade two weeks of training in exchange for the change-order work. Considering this evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment and indulging every reasonable inference that would support the trial court s finding, we conclude that a reasonable and fair-minded person could conclude that the parties agreed to trade three weeks of training in exchange for $11,375.66 worth of change-order work. Accordingly, the evidence is legally sufficient to support trial court s implied finding. Based on our review of all the evidence, we conclude that the trial court s finding was not against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. While there is some evidence to indicate that Transdyn had agreed to trade two weeks, there is testimony and evidence suggesting otherwise. It is for the trial court, however, to resolve such conflicts. Id. at 696-97. The court could 17 have credited the testimony and evidence of the value of the work traded to conclude that the parties intended to trade three weeks of training for approximately $12,000 of change-order work. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court s finding was supported by factually sufficient evidence. ATS s second issue is overruled. Incidental Damages ATS s remaining issues on appeal challenge the trial court s award of incidental damages to Transdyn. The trial court awarded the incidental damages under article 2 of the Texas Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ), which the court had previously determined governed the parties contract. Under the UCC, a seller of goods can recover its damages, including incidental damages, [w]hen the buyer fails to pay the price as it becomes due. Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. §2.709 (West 2009). Incidental damages under the UCC include any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions incurred . . . in the transportation, care and custody of goods after the buyer s breach . . . or otherwise resulting from the breach. Id. §2.710 (West 2009). With respect to its award of damages and incidental damages, the trial court made the following findings of fact: ¢ATS and Transdyn entered into a contract for Transdyn to furnish labor and materials related to the control equipment for the Walnut Creek project; ¢ATS agreed to pay the agreed price and reasonable value for said electrical control system pursuant to the terms of the . . . [parties contract] ; ¢Transdyn furnished the labor and control equipment materials in accordance with the contractual requirements ; 18 ¢Transdyn performed all conditions, covenants, and promises to be performed by Transdyn pursuant to the . . . [parties contract] with ATS except that it failed to perform the fiber optic terminations and Performance Acceptance Test . . . related repairs ; ¢ATS failed to pay Transdyn pursuant to the [parties contract] ; ¢Transdyn made timely and contractually correct demands for payment . . . . ; ¢Transdyn is entitled to the $67,227.00 balance due under the [parties contract] ; and ¢Transdyn is entitled to incidental delay damages in the amount of $65,397.00. A. When Payment Became Due Under the UCC In its third issue, ATS contends that the trial court erred in awarding incidental damages because Transdyn offered no evidence or insufficient evidence that ATS failed topay Transdyn when payment became due under the terms of the parties contract. Specifically, ATS contends that Transdyn failed to produce evidence that payment was due from ATS when Transdyn submitted its invoice requesting final payment. The parties disagree on when payment was due under the contract. Before we can determine whether Transdyn produced sufficient evidence that payment was due, then, we turn to the trial court s finding of when payment was due under the terms of the parties contract. Both parties agreed that the milestone payment agreement sets forth the parties agreement about when Transdyn was to be paid. The parties disagree, however, on the meaning of that agreement. ATS argued at trial that payments were due under this agreement only after each milestone had been reached and, thus, final payment was not due until after the final 19 milestone approval of the PICS manuals was achieved. The testimony of both parties witnesses established that the last three of themilestones listed in the payment agreement had not been reached when Transdyn sent its last invoice demanding final payment. Thus, ATS argues it did not owe the money when Transdyn demanded payment. Transdyn argued at trial that payment was due thirty days after it issued an invoice and, further, that final payment was due thirty days after the project was initially scheduled to be finished, or approximately November 30, 2001; thus, when it submitted its final invoice in January 2002, payment was past due. Rather than make an express finding as to when the payment was due under the milestone payment agreement, the trial court simply found that ATS failed to pay Transdyn pursuant to the [parties contract] and awarded Transdyn damages based on its contention that the delay began in November 2001. Nonetheless, because it was established at trial that the last three milestones had not been reached when Transdyn sent out its final invoice and because the trial court found that ATS breached the contract, the trial court necessarily found, as was argued by Transdyn, that final payment was due approximately November 2001. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 299 (omitted elements will be supplied by presumption in support of judgment if supported by evidence). The trial court could not have found that, as ATS argued, payment was due upon completion of each milestone and also have found that ATS was in breach of the contract. Accordingly, we determine that the trial court impliedly found that final payment was due on approximately November 30, 2001. Based on this implied finding and also because ATS does not challenge the trial court s interpretation of this contract, we review the evidence to determine if it is factually and legally sufficient to support the trial court s implied finding that ATS did not pay Transdyn in full 20 by approximately November 30, 2001. Our review of the record indicates the following evidence supporting the trial court s implied finding: ¢January 15, 2002 invoice demanding paymentin full; ¢January 8, 2002 Transdyn letter to ATS stating that the contract should have been completed and fully paid by September 2001; ¢January 15, 2002 letter from Transdyn s counsel to Cajun, Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., and Fidelity and Guaranty Insurance Underwriters, notifying them that ATS owes Transdyn $477,500 for work on Walnut Creek project; ¢February 8, 2002 email from City of Austin project manager stating that no further payments will be made to Transdyn; ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn was never paid within thirty days from the invoice date; ¢Otis Maxwell s (Transdyn representative) testimony that Transdyn was never paid within thirty days from the invoice date; ¢Bill Driesslein s (ATS s chief financial officer) testimony that ATS paid Transdyn s invoices up until the time the difficulties all arose when Transdyn left the job ; and ¢Driesslien s testimony that Transdyn was not paid according to the parties payment agreement. Considering this evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment and indulging every reasonable inference that would support this finding, we conclude that a reasonable and fair-minded person could conclude that ATS did not pay Transdyn in full by November 30, 2001. We also note that ATS s brief on appeal cites to no evidence in the record indicating that ATS paid Transdyn by the end of November 2001, nor did we find evidence contrary to the finding. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the trial court s finding that ATS did not pay Transdyn 21 in full was so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it was clearly wrong and unjust. See Dow Chem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 242. We hold that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court s finding that ATS failed to pay Transdyn pursuant to the [parties contract]. We overrule ATS s third point of error. B. Overhead Expenses In its fourth issue, ATS contends that the trial court erred in awarding incidental damages because the incidental delay damages requested by Transdyn are not recoverable by a seller under the UCC. Specifically, ATS asserts that overhead costs, which were included in Transdyn s incidental damages, are unrecoverable consequential damages.4 Thus, the question we must answer is whether overhead expenses are recoverable as incidental damages under the UCC. ATS argues that overhead costs are not recoverable as incidental damages because section 2.709 does not specifically provide for the recovery of reasonable overhead. See Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. §2.709. As support, ATS points to section 2.708 s inclusion of reasonable overhead as an element of a seller s damages for non-acceptance or repudiation. See id. §2.708 4 Transdyn used the Eichleay formula to determine its incidental damages. The Eichleay formula calculates a contractor s unabsorbed home overhead costs attributed to a government-caused delay in connection with a government construction contract. See Eichleay Corp., ASBCA No. 5183, 60-2 B.C.A. (CCH) ¶2688, aff d, 61-1 B.C.A. (CCH) ¶2894 (1960). Home office overhead costs are the costs incurred by the contractor for maintaining its whole business, thus, they cannot be attributed to any single contract or job. See id. The Eichleay formula seeks to equitably allocate the portion of the home office overhead costs allocable to a particular contract. Id.; see also Chilton Ins. Co. v. Pate &amp; Pate Enters., Inc., 930 S.W.2d 877, 892 n.10 (Tex. App. San Antonio 1996, pet. denied). Thus, Eichleay damages compensate the injured contractor for the extra costs incurred as a result of the delay. 22 (West 2009). We are not persuaded by ATS s argument. The fact that overhead expenses are specifically mentioned in section 2.708 as being a possible component of a seller s profit does not mean that they cannot be incidental damages recoverable under section 2.709. Instead, we look to section2.710 s definition of incidental damages to determine what incidental damages can include: Incidental damages . . . include any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions incurred in stopping delivery, in the transportation, care and custody of goods after the buyer s breach, in connection with return or resale of the goods or otherwise resulting from the breach. Id. §2.710. The commentary to section 2.710 adds that the purpose of this section is [t]o authorize reimbursement of the seller for expenses reasonably incurred by him as a result of the buyer s breach. The section sets forth the principal normal and necessary additional elements of damage flowing from the breach but intends to allow all commercially reasonable expenditures made by the seller. Id. (emphasis added). Although we have found no cases addressing whether Eichleay-type damages are incidental damages under the UCC, we conclude that the types of expenses included in overhead cost calculations i.e., business expenses, such as rent, utilities, salaries, insurance premiums, security costs can fall within the UCC s definition of incidental damages if those costs were commercially reasonable charges or expenses incurred as a result of the buyer s breach. See Wagner &amp; Brown, Ltd. v. Sheppard, 282 S.W.3d 419, 425 (Tex. 2008) ( overhead expenses include administration, supervision, office services, and warehousing expenses); Strauss v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 67 S.W.3d 428, 440 n.7 (Tex. App. Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (overhead 23 expenses include office rent, salaries to employees, payroll taxes, and other fixed costs of doing business ). We overrule ATS s fourth point of error. C. Reasonable Certainty of Incidental Damages In its fifth issue, ATS asserts that the trial court erred in awarding incidental delay damages because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence of the reasonable certainty of such damages or that such damages were actually incurred. Specifically, ATS contends that, under Malone v. Carl Kisabeth Co., 726 S.W.2d 188, 192 (Tex. App. Fort Worth 1987, writ ref d n.r.e.), Transdyn had to prove that it paid a third party to store the equipment or that it was foreclosed from storing other equipment on its own premises. We note that Transdyn s incidental damages include more than just its storage expenses. Nonetheless, assuming without deciding that Malone applies to the facts of this case, the Malone court declined to award the seller its storage costs as incidental damages because there was no proof that the seller suffered any loss by having to pay to have [the product] stored elsewhere or was foreclosed from storing other [product] on [his] premises due to [the product] occupying space. Id. Here, Transdyn s witness testified the equipment was taking up valuable space in our shop that we would loved to have had to stage other projects. Transdyn s witness also testified that Transdyn had to maintain a security system for the warehouse, it had to pay insurance for the warehouse if equipment was in it, and that Transdyn incurred staff expenses relating to the inventory in the warehouse. Thus, Transdyn met the Malone requirements. Regarding its incidental damages, Transdyn s witness also testified that Transdyn incurred overhead and interest expenses because of the delays caused by ATS. Documents admitted 24 into evidence, mostly consisting of letters from Transdyn to ATS complaining about the delays, specifically refer to damages being incurred as a result of the delays. Considering this evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment and indulging every reasonable inference that would support the trial court s finding, we conclude that a reasonable and fair-minded person could conclude that Transdyn incurred expenses as a result of ATS s breach. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court s judgment. In reviewing all the evidence, we find nothing that controverts the evidence that Transdyn incurred expenses as a result of the delay. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence is factually sufficient to support the trial court s conclusion that Transdyn incurred incidental damages. ATS s fifth issue is overruled. Causes for the Delay In its final point of error, ATS asserts the trial court erred in awarding incidental delay damages because there was no evidence or factually insufficient evidence that Transdyn s delay damages resulted from ATS s breach or that ATS caused any delays. Our review of the record indicates the following evidence supporting the trial court s finding that Transdyn incurred incidental delay damages as a result of ATS s breach of the contract or that ATS caused delays: ¢Testimony and handwritten notes of Luiz that ATS representative told him that the contract would be complete in approximately 360 days; ¢September 14, 2000 letter and purchase order from ATS accepting contract with Transdyn and authorizing Transdynto proceed with contract; ¢October 26, 2000 email from Transdyn to ATS stating that Transdyn is being affected by delays on the project; 25 ¢November 9, 2000 Revised Payment Schedule from ATS indicating that expected pay date for final payment was September 2001; ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn expected to be paid within thirty days of invoice date, but was never paid within thirty days of invoice dates; ¢April 16, 2001 letter from Transdyn to ATS requesting payment of past due invoices and notifying ATS that Transdyn is ready to ship equipment; ¢August 7, 2001 letter from Transdyn complaining about delays and damages caused by the delays; ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn submitted its work in a timely fashion and was never cited for delays; ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn incurred additional costs, including financing costs, as a result of the delays in the construction project; ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn was ready to perform on the contract but that ATS was not ready; specifically that Transdyn had the equipment ready to go in September 2001, but that it was not started until the early part of 2002; ¢October 2, 2001 letter from Transdyn to ATS complaining about schedule delays, indicating that Transdyn was able to perform according to agreed schedule, and stating that Transdyn was incurring additional costs as result of the schedule delays and of not being paid in a timely fashion; ¢Luiz s testimony that approval of Transdyn s hardware submittals was delayed by sixty days; ¢November 7, 2001 letter from Transdyn to ATS setting forth the damages Transdyn was incurring as a result of the delays on the construction project; ¢January 8, 2002 letter from Transdyn stating that Transdyn should have been paid in full by September 2001 and that it had incurred damages as a result of the delay in payments; ¢Luiz s testimony that as of November 7, 2001 Transdyn was waiting on ATS; ¢Transdyn exhibit setting forth its Eichleay damages resulting from delays; 26 ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn s delay damages resulted from 205-day delay between the contract completion date and the date Transdyn was finally paid; ¢Luiz s testimony that, under the terms of the contract, ATS was responsible for accepting Transdyn s schedule of values and hardware list; ¢Luiz s testimony that the specifications for the project warranted that the project will be completed in 365 days or the owner would assess liquidated damages against the prime contractor; ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn was contracted to build the job in 365 days, and we were damaged without any compensation for an extension of that ; ¢Luiz s testimony that Transdyn incurred damages because Transdyn was required to complete the project in 365 days and had the equipment ready for delivery in that time frame, but could not ship the equipment because of the delays on the project; ¢Otis Maxwell s testimony regarding ATS delays, including his testimony that work outside Transdyn s scope of work, which affected Transdyn s ability to complete its work, was not completed in a timely fashion; ¢March 6, 2002 letter from Transdyn to ATS referencing delays and costs incurred as a result of those delays; ¢Cajun s letters to ATS regarding Notification of Delay to Project Schedule ; ¢March 22, 2001 48 Hour Notice of Failure to Perform from Cajun to ATS; ¢October 15, 2001 letter from Cajun to ATS regarding Notification of Delay to Project Schedule and informing ATS that it was responsible for several delays to the project; ¢October 15, 2001 48 Hour Notice of Failure to Perform from Cajun to ATS; ¢Elliot House s testimony that Transdyn had all the equipment to the project site by September 2001; and ¢Elliot House s testimony that Cajun assessed damages against ATS for delays in the construction project. 27 Considering this evidence in thelight most favorable to the trial court s finding and indulging every reasonable inference that would support the trial court s finding, we conclude that a reasonable and fair-minded person would conclude that ATS caused delays and that Transdyn incurred incidental damages as a result of the delays. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the trial court s finding. ATS provided the following controverting evidence: ¢October 27, 2000 email from ATS to Cajun stating that delay in submittal approvals were caused by Cajun; ¢December 11, 2000 fax from ATS to Wesco complaining about delays in the approval of submittal requests; ¢March 12, 2001 City of Austin project notes for Walnut Creek project indicating that engineers were responsible for delay in submittal approval; ¢March 12, 2001 letter from ATS to Cajun regarding delays caused by rain and failure to receive submittal approvals; ¢October 19, 2001 letter from ATS to Cajun responding to allegations that ATS delayed the project and complaining that Cajun was responsible for delays on the project; ¢Luiz s testimony that the engineers on the project were responsible for the hardware submittal approvals; ¢October 2, 2001 letter from Transdyn to ATS indicating that Transdyn was aware that the activities of others were causing ATS to be delayed; ¢Luiz s testimony that ATS s representative told him that ATS had difficulty performing its work on the project due to problems that were out of ATS s control; ¢Luiz s testimony that he was aware that ATS was not the only entity that could affect when the tests occurred; that the City of Austin, Cajun, the engineer, other subcontracts, and weather could affect when tests occurred; 28 ¢Testimony from Elliot House of ATS that the delays in the project were caused by excessive rain in the Fall of 2000, other contractors failure to complete work that had to be completed before ATS s work, including the approval of project submittals, Transdyn s failure to assist with the final testing of its equipment, and defective equipment Transdyn provided; and ¢Testimony from Elliot House that he disagreed with Transdyn s contentions that the engineers were late in approving submittals. The trial court resolved the conflicts in the evidence in favor of Transdyn by concluding that ATS caused delays and that Transdyn incurred damages as a result of those delays. Viewing all the evidence, we conclude the trial court s finding is not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. ATS also contends that to recover incidental delay damages Transdyn had to (1) identify each action causing a delay; (2) identify the party responsible for this action; (3) locate this action in the schedule; and (4) identify the impact of the delay. See Rowan Cos. v. Southwest Tenant Constr., Inc., No. 01-95-01514-CV, 1999 WL 97545, at \\\\*4 (Tex. App.Houston [1st Dist.] Feb. 18, 1999, no pet.) (mem. op.). We disagree. Rowan is not a UCC case and, thus, does not address the determination of incidental damages under the UCC. See id. The UCC allows recovery of incidental damages resulting from the breach. See Tex. Bus. &amp; Com Code Ann. §2.710. We can find no cases interpreting this UCC language to require the elements found in Rowan, and the cases that interpreted this language have only determined that it requires that the damages have been incurred prior to the breach; thus, they do not inform our decision here. See James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code §7-16(a) (5th ed. 1996). 29 ATS also cites to City of Beaumont v. Excavators &amp; Constructors, Inc., 870 S.W.2d 123 (Tex. App. Beaumont 1993, writ denied), for the proposition that Transdyn has to prove that ATS was responsible for each act or omission which caused the delay. City of Beaumont is distinguishable for at least four reasons: (1) it is not a UCCcase; (2) it involved a claim for lost opportunity damages incurred when a contractor allegedly was prevented from finishing a contract before it was due to be completed; (3) the contractor was seeking damages from a defendant that was not a party to its construction contract; and (4) the contract at issue contained a no-damage-for-delay clause. Accordingly, we decline to apply City of Beaumont to this case. We overrule ATS s sixth issue. CONCLUSION Because we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in admitting Luiz s testimony and the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court s findings, we overrule ATS s issues on appeal and affirm the trial court s judgment.5 \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Jan P.

The House of Representatives contains 435 members, while the Senate contains 100 members. The members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms, while the members of the Senate serve six-year terms. The members of each chamber are not subject to any term limits.\\nA proposed law is known as a bill, which can be introduced in either chamber of Congress. After a bill is introduced, it will be referred to one or more standing committees. These committees determine whether a bill should move forward, and they also can propose amendments to a bill. If a bill passes through the committee phase, it will return to the chamber in which it was introduced. This chamber will discuss the bill and consider any amendments suggested by a committee or by members of the chamber. Once the bill has been finalized, the original chamber will vote on whether to pass it.\\nIf the bill is passed, it will go through the same process in the other chamber. Sometimes the second chamber will amend the bill and pass a different version of it. A bill will not reach the next stage unless the differences between these versions are resolved. Each chamber must pass identical versions of the bill.\\nIf each chamber of Congress passes the bill, the U.S. President will review it. The President may sign the bill into law, or the President may take no action, which usually means that the bill will become law. If the President vetoes the bill, however, it will return to Congress. Congress can vote to override the President's veto and pass the bill into law. Overriding the President's veto requires a two-thirds majority vote in each chamber of Congress.\\n* [2022 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2022/)\\n* [2021 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2021/)\\n* [2020 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2020/)\\n* [2019 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2019/)\\n* [2018 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2018/)\\n* [2017 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2017/)\\n* [2016 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2016/)\\n* [2015 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2015/)\\n* [2014 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2014/)\\n* [2013 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2013/)\\n* [2012 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2012/)\\n* [2011 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2011/)\\n* [2010 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2010/)\\n* [2009 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2009/)\\n* [2008 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2008/)\\n* [2007 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2007/)\\n* [2006 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2006/)\\n* [2005 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2005/)\\n* [2004 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2004/)\\n* [2003 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2003/)\\n* [2002 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2002/)\\n* [2001 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2001/)\\n* [2000 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/2000/)\\n* [1999 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/1999/)\\n* [1998 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/1998/)\\n* [1997 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/1997/)\\n* [1996 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/1996/)\\n* [1995 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/1995/)\\n* [1994 U.S. Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/us/1994/)\\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)and[Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)apply.\\n**Free Daily Summaries in Your Inbox**\\nYou're all set!

Federal laws apply in California as they do across all 50 states. In addition to the U.S. Constitution, which is the supreme law of the U.S., federal laws include statutes that are periodically codified in the U.S. Code. Federal laws also include decisions by courts that interpret federal laws. Finally, federal laws include regulations issued by federal administrative agencies to implement federal laws. You can explore federal laws and related resources by visiting the[federal law](https://law.justia.com/us/)section of the Justia site.\\nThe state of California also has its own state laws. California state laws include the California Constitution, laws passed by the California legislature and periodically codified in the California Code, and decisions by courts that interpret California laws.\\nThe current California Constitution dates from 1879. Some of its distinctive features include a provision establishing English as the official language of California and a provision that strongly supports term limits for legislators. Article XVIII provides the processes for amending the California Constitution. Under Section 1, two-thirds of the members of each chamber of the legislature can propose an amendment or revision to be placed on a ballot. Section 2 covers constitutional conventions, which will be proposed on a ballot if two-thirds of each chamber vote in favor. Finally, Section 3 provides the process for amendments based on ballot initiatives, which are further described in Article II.\\nThe California Code contains the laws passed by the California legislature. These laws and the provisions of the California Constitution are often interpreted by the California Supreme Court and the six California Courts of Appeal. Four federal district courts in California also issue decisions that may affect California residents. These are the Central, Eastern, Northern, and Southern District Courts of California. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals holds the authority to review decisions by federal district courts in California. Sometimes the U.S. Supreme Court may review a case that has been appealed from the Ninth Circuit or from the California Supreme Court.\\n## [California Constitution](https://law.justia.com/constitution/california/)\\n## [California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/)\\n* [2024 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2024/)\\n* [2023 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2023/)\\n* [2022 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2022/)\\n* [2021 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2021/)\\n* [2020 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2020/)\\n* [2019 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2019/)\\n* [2018 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2018/)\\n* [2017 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2017/)\\n* [2016 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2016/)\\n* [2015 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2015/)\\n* [2014 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2014/)\\n* [2013 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2013/)\\n* [2012 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2012/)\\n* [2011 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/)\\n* [2010 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2010/)\\n* [2009 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2009/)\\n* [2007 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2007/)\\n* [2005 California Code](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2005/)## [California Code of Regulations](https://regulations.justia.com/states/california/)\\n## [California Case Law](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/)\\n## Browse by Court\\n* [California Supreme Court Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/)\\n* [California Court of Appeal Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/)## Browse by Volume\\n* [Cal. 2d](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/cal2d/)\\n* [Cal. 3d](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/cal3d/)\\n* [Cal. 4th](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/cal4th/)\\n* [Cal.

Lower courts on the federal level include the U.S. Courts of Appeals, U.S. District Courts, the U.S. Court of Claims, and the U.S. Court of International Trade and U.S. Bankruptcy Courts. Federal courts hear cases involving matters related to the United States Constitution, other federal laws and regulations, and certain matters that involve parties from different states or countries and large sums of money in dispute.\\nEach state has its own judicial system that includes trial and appellate courts. The highest court in each state is often referred to as the “supreme” court, although there are some exceptions to this rule, for example, the New York Court of Appeals or the Maryland Court of Appeals. State courts generally hear cases involving state constitutional matters, state law and regulations, although state courts may also generally hear cases involving federal laws. States also usually have courts that handle only a specific subset of legal matters, such as family law and probate.\\nCase law, also known as precedent or common law, is the body of prior judicial decisions that guide judges deciding issues before them. Depending on the relationship between the deciding court and the precedent, case law may be binding or merely persuasive. For example, a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is binding on all federal district courts within the Fifth Circuit, but a court sitting in California (whether a federal or state court) is not strictly bound to follow the Fifth Circuit’s prior decision. Similarly, a decision by one district court in New York is not binding on another district court, but the original court’s reasoning might help guide the second court in reaching its decision.\\nDecisions by the U.S. Supreme Court are binding on all federal and state courts.\\n[Read more](#)\\n## [U.S. Federal Courts](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/)\\n**[U.S. Supreme Court (1759 - present)](https://supreme.justia.com/)****[U.S. Federal Courts of Appeals](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/)**\\n## Reported Opinions From the U.S. Federal Courts of Appeals\\n* [Federal Reporter, 2nd Series (F.2d) (1924-1993)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/)\\n* [Federal Reporter, 3rd Series (F.3d) (1993-present)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/)## Opinions From the U.S. Federal Courts of Appeals\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca1/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca3/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca6/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca11/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cafc/)\\n* [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/caaf/)\\n* [U.S. Court of International Trade](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cit/)\\n* [U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/fiscr/)\\n**[U.S. Federal District Courts](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/)**\\n**Reported Opinions From the U.S. Federal District Courts**\\n* [Bankruptcy Reporter (B.R.)

Federal laws apply in Florida as they do across all 50 states. In addition to the U.S. Constitution, which is the supreme law of the U.S., federal laws include statutes that are periodically codified in the U.S. Code. Federal laws also include decisions by courts that interpret federal laws. Finally, federal laws include regulations issued by federal administrative agencies to implement federal laws. You can explore federal laws and related resources by visiting the[federal law](https://law.justia.com/us/)section of the Justia site.\\nThe state of Florida also has its own state laws. Florida state laws include the Florida Constitution, laws passed by the Florida legislature and periodically codified in the Florida Statutes, and decisions by courts that interpret Florida laws.\\nThe current version of the Florida Constitution was adopted in 1968 and consists of 12 articles. Florida provides more ways to amend the Constitution than any other state. Article XI outlines the processes for amending the Florida Constitution. These include ballot initiatives under Section 3 and constitutional convention proposals based on ballot initiatives under Section 4. The Florida Legislature also can place a proposed amendment on a ballot under Section 1 if 60 percent of each chamber of the legislature votes in its favor. Other ways to amend the Florida Constitution start with proposals by the Florida Constitution Revision Commission under Section 2 and the Florida Taxation and Budget Reform Commission under Section 6. Once an amendment is on a ballot, it must receive 60 percent of the votes, or more in some cases.\\nThe Florida Statutes contain the laws passed by the Florida legislature. These laws and the provisions of the Florida Constitution are often interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court and the five Florida District Courts of Appeal. Three federal district courts in Florida also issue decisions that may affect Florida residents. These are the Northern, Middle, and Southern District Courts of Florida. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals holds the authority to review decisions by federal district courts in Florida.

Federal laws apply in Texas as they do across all 50 states. In addition to the U.S. Constitution, which is the supreme law of the U.S., federal laws include statutes that are periodically codified in the U.S. Code. Federal laws also include decisions by courts that interpret federal laws. Finally, federal laws include regulations issued by federal administrative agencies to implement federal laws. You can explore federal laws and related resources by visiting the[federal law](https://law.justia.com/us/)section of the Justia site.\\nThe state of Texas also has its own state laws. Texas state laws include the Texas Constitution, laws passed by the Texas legislature and periodically codified in the Texas Statutes, and decisions by courts that interpret Texas laws.\\nEffective since 1876, the Texas Constitution is the seventh version of this document and the fifth that was created since Texas became a state. It has been amended several hundred times since it took effect. Article 17 provides the process for amending the Constitution, which requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber of the legislature in favor of an amendment. The proposed amendment then will appear on a ballot. If voters reject the amendment, the legislature may propose it again on a later ballot. Proposed amendments have been approved at a rate of nearly 75 percent. The legislature may call a special election to consider a proposed amendment if requirements regarding notice and publication can be met.\\nThe Texas Statutes contain the laws passed by the Texas legislature. These laws and the provisions of the Texas Constitution are often interpreted by the Texas Supreme Court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (the highest court in Texas for criminal cases), and the 15 Texas Courts of Appeals. Four federal district courts in Texas also issue decisions that may affect Texas residents. These are the Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern District Courts of Texas. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals holds the authority to review decisions by federal district courts in Texas. Sometimes the U.S. Supreme Court may review a case that has been appealed from the Fifth Circuit or from the Texas Supreme Court or the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.\\n## [Texas Constitution](https://law.justia.com/constitution/texas/)\\n## [Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/)\\n* [2023 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2023/)\\n* [2022 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2022/)\\n* [2021 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2021/)\\n* [2019 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2019/)\\n* [2017 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2017/)\\n* [2015 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2015/)\\n* [2013 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2013/)\\n* [2011 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2011/)\\n* [2009 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2009/)\\n* [2005 Texas Statutes](https://law.justia.com/codes/texas/2005/)## [Texas Administrative Code](https://regulations.justia.com/states/texas/)\\n## [Texas Case Law](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/)\\n* [Texas Supreme Court Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/supreme-court/)\\n* [Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/)\\n* [Texas First Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/first-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Second Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/second-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Third Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/third-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Fourth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/fourth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Fifth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/fifth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Sixth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/sixth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Seventh Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/seventh-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Eighth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/eighth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Ninth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/ninth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Tenth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/tenth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Eleventh Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/eleventh-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Twelfth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/twelfth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Thirteenth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/thirteenth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Fourteenth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/fourteenth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Fifteenth Court of Appeals Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/fifteenth-court-of-appeals/)\\n* [Texas Special Court of Review Decisions](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/special-court-of-review/)## [Federal Courts - Texas](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/)\\n* [U.S. Supreme Court](https://supreme.justia.com)\\n* [Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/circuit-5)\\n* [Texas Federal District Courts](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/)\\n* [Texas Eastern District Court](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txedce/)\\n* [Texas Northern District Court](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txndce/)\\n* [Texas Southern District Court](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txsdce/)\\n* [Texas Western District Court](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txwdce/)## [Texas State Resources](https://www.justia.com/us-states/texas)\\n### [Texas City Websites &amp; City Codes](https://law.justia.com/texas/cities)\\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)and[Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)apply.\\n**Free Daily Summaries in Your Inbox**\\nYou're all set!

            "--FINAL RESULT: Here's a comprehensive analysis of Texas case law relating to liquidated damages, design changes, and construction delays. I've identified eight pertinent cases, summarizing their rulings, and describing how each could apply to the issues like those between Austin Proper JV, LLC and Austin Commercial.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Loggins Construction Co. v. Stephen F. Austin State University Bd. of Regents\n",
            "- **Link**: [Loggins Construction Co. v. Stephen F. Austin State University Bd. of Regents](https://casetext.com/case/loggins-const-co-v-stephen-f-austin-state-university-bd-of-regents)\n",
            "- **Ruling Summary**: The court ruled that a liquidated damages provision can be enforceable if it is intended as a genuine pre-estimate of damages, and not a penalty.\n",
            "- **Application & Impact**: This ruling indicates that Austin Proper JV, LLC must demonstrate the liquidated damages in their contract were a genuine pre-estimate of losses due to delays, not a penalty, to enforce the $4.625 million claim.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Austin Traffic Signal Construction Co. v. Transdyn Controls, Inc.\n",
            "- **Link**: [Austin Traffic Signal Construction Co. v. Transdyn Controls, Inc.](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/third-court-of-appeals/2010/19477.html)\n",
            "- **Ruling Summary**: Delays contributed by multiple contractors and design changes were evaluated, showing some compensation due to adjustments in project timelines and responsibilities.\n",
            "- **Application & Impact**: If Austin Commercial can demonstrate that delays were caused by design changes initiated by Austin Proper JV or other factors beyond their control, they might mitigate or reduce the liquidated damages.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. La Villa Independent School Dist.\n",
            "- **Link**: [Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. La Villa Independent School Dist.](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/commercial-union-ins-co-884914412)\n",
            "- **Ruling Summary**: Emphasizes the importance of clear contractual language regarding completion timelines and the conditions for extending these times.\n",
            "- **Application & Impact**: Clear terms defining responsibility for delays must exist within the contracts between Austin Proper and subcontractors like Austin Commercial. Lack of clarity can shift obligations.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Stool\n",
            "- **Link**: [Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Stool](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/fidelity-and-deposit-co-893518876)\n",
            "- **Ruling Summary**: Deals with the costs incurred from project delays and how those should be factored into financial damages and reparations.\n",
            "- **Application & Impact**: Austin Commercial could present evidence of incurred costs due to owner-related delays or changes to argue against full liability for liquidated damages.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. Stewart v. Basey\n",
            "- **Link**: [Stewart v. Basey](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/stewart-v-basey-no-888914620)\n",
            "- **Ruling Summary**: This case highlights the necessity of having damages that reflect actual anticipated or incurred losses.\n",
            "- **Application & Impact**: Supports a requirement for Austin Proper JV to prove their estimated damages reflect true anticipated losses versus speculative figures.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. U.S. Leasing Corp. v. Smith\n",
            "- **Link**: [U.S. Leasing Corp. v. Smith](https://case-law.vlex.com/vid/u-s-leasing-corp-893340689)\n",
            "- **Ruling Summary**: Examines when penalty clauses are deemed enforceable in contracts.\n",
            "- **Application & Impact**: Demonstrates to Austin Commercial the possibility to contest any penalty component within the liquidated damages claimed by demonstrating an unfair burden.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 7. Community Development Service, Inc. v. Replacement Parts Mfg., Inc.\n",
            "- **Link**: Not provided in search results, refers to how contract terms regarding completion and payment are interpreted in disputes.\n",
            "- **Ruling Summary**: Highlights the necessity for clear contracts, with courts often siding with terms as written unless proven unconscionable or incorrect.\n",
            "- **Application & Impact**: Points toward ensuring all contractual obligations and potential liabilities for changes are clearly detailed in the contract to support or refute claims.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 8. Zachry Construction Corporation v. Port of Houston Authority\n",
            "- **Link**: Not directly listed but generally refers to significant Texas precedent on no-damages-for-delay clauses.\n",
            "- **Ruling Summary**: Integral in assessing when and how a construction delay can bear financial penalties or defenses.\n",
            "- **Application & Impact**: Relevant if no-damages-for-delay clauses are featured in contracts, potentially limiting Austin Commercial's financial liability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Each case offers a nuanced perspective on how construction-related disputes over liquidated damages, project delays, and design changes might be adjudicated. Parties involved would need to carefully analyze their existing contracts under these precedents to assess their probable standing in legal disputes.\n"
